            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
            paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least
            five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
            though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what
            constitutes a paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper
            is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing,
            particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one
            sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of
            sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer
            to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens
            in the rest of the paragraph.
